            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know not how to Own the humble Opinion I have of theſe <hi>Poems</hi> at the ſame time that I preſent them to your Highneſs.</p>
            <p>Were it poſſible for me to write what could have any proportion of Merit to your Highneſs's Favour, I ſhould bring
<pb facs="tcp:98889:4"/>my Offering with much more Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Goodneſs in Princes naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions trouble to Themſelves and ſuch as are near to them: His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been pleas'd to receive favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably an honeſt endeavour of my Muſe, which was my greateſt Encouragement to this Addreſs. But ſo raging was that Seaſon of Faction; that no Son of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty could want Indignation enough to conſtitute a <hi>Poet.</hi> That ever the Hearts of Men could conceive ſuch Injuſtice and Ingratitude towards a Prince that had ſo highly obliged the Nation, can onely have belief with the Age in which it was tranſacted.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98889:4"/>
            <p>But Heaven has once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in Miracles, to eſtabliſh the Royal Family; and in them Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Nations. The Storm is ſpent, the Peoples Sight reſtor'd, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for ever diſarm'd of Pretences. Bankrupt Prodigals are no longer made Guardians of <hi>Property,</hi> nor Atheiſts of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whither then ſhould the Muſes now betake themſelves with the Songs of Peace, but to the fair Branches of the Royal Stem? whoſe Praiſes
<pb facs="tcp:98889:5"/>and Perſections can they more juſtly celebrate than thoſe that ſo eminently adorn your Highneſs. To what cauſe can they more aſſign our new eſtabliſh'd Happineſs, than to a Reward from Providence for that moſt illuſtrious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of all Virtues in your Highneſs, from your very Infancy. And as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Illuſtration of your being conſtituted by Heaven for a general Bleſſing; We triumph in your Nuptials with a moſt auſpicious Prince, who (beſides his perſonal Conduct and Valour) has ſtrengthned our Monarchy with a moſt powerful Alliance. Your Blooming
<pb facs="tcp:98889:5"/>Beauties were juſtly made the Prize of his early Fame.</p>
            <p>All Hearts therefore are employ'd in Addreſſes to Heaven for Your Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and impatient for the Royal Bleſſing You promiſe.</p>
            <p>If I had a Talent of <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> I ſhould decline it in addreſsing to Your Highneſs, of whom the ableſt Wit cannot expreſs ſo much as the plaineſt Heart conceives. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes moſt charming Condeſcenſion, the heavenly Sweetneſs of Your Temper,
<pb facs="tcp:98889:6"/>Your unaffected and habitual Piety, Your Generoſity and Charity are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally their own Regiſters, tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Rhetorick, much more what can be expreſt by,</p>

                  <l>Which yet in part the Bleſſing did deſtroy;</l>
